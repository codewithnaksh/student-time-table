# 🏫 School Time Table (Pure HTML)

A structured and responsive **School Time Table** created using **HTML tables**.  
This project helped me dive deep into table layouts, understand modern HTML5 attributes, and explore deprecated tags that are no longer in use.

## 📚 What This Project Covers

- ✅ Creating structured layouts with `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`
